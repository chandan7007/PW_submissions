    "#Soap\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP relies exclusively on XML to provide messaging services. Microsoft originally developed SOAP to take the place of older technologies that don’t work well on the internet such as the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) and Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). These technologies fail because they rely on binary messaging. The XML messaging that SOAP employs works better over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "After an initial release, Microsoft submitted SOAP to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) where it was standardized. SOAP is designed to support expansion, so it has all sorts of other acronyms and abbreviations associated with it, such as WS-Addressing, WS-Policy, WS-Security, WS-Federation, WS-ReliableMessaging, WS-Coordination, WS-AtomicTransaction, and WS-RemotePortlets. In fact, you can find a whole laundry list of these standards on Web Services Standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point is that SOAP is highly extensible, but you only use the pieces you need for a particular task. For example, when using a public web service that’s freely available to everyone, you really don’t have much need for WS-Security.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####Rest\n",
    "REST provides a lighter-weight alternative. Many developers found SOAP cumbersome and hard to use. For example, working with SOAP in JavaScript means writing a ton of code to perform simple tasks because you must create the required XML structure every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using XML to make a request, REST (usually) relies on a simple URL. In some situations you must provide additional information, but most web services using REST rely exclusively on using the URL approach. REST can use four different HTTP 1.1 verbs (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) to perform tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike SOAP, REST doesn’t have to use XML to provide the response. You can find REST-based web services that output the data in Command Separated Value (CSV), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and Really Simple Syndication (RSS). The point is you can obtain the output you need, in a form that’s easy to parse within the language you’re using for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#Shortcomings of soaps\n",
    "\n",
    "As SOAP can only transfer messages as XML files, your SOAP API will be less performant, as XML is a verbose format compared to JSON. API calls made to your server will need more bandwidth and it will take more time to process the request and transfer the response back to the client."
