    "In statistics, there are four main types of data: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. \n",
    "These types of data are used to describe the nature of the data being collected or analyzed, \n",
    "and they help determine the appropriate statistical tests to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "a)Nominal Data:\n",
    "    Nominal data is a type of data that consists of categories or names that cannot be ordered or ranked.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Nominal data is often used to categorize observations into groups, and the groups are not comparable. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    In other words, nominal data has no inherent order or ranking. Examples of nominal data include gender (male/female), \n",
    "    \n",
    "    race (White/Black/Asian), religion (Christianity/Islam/Judaism), and blood type (A/B/AB/O).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Nominal data can be represented using frequency tables and bar charts,\n",
    "    \n",
    "    which display the number or proportion of observations in each category.\n",

    "b)Ordinal Data:\n",
    "    Ordinal data is a type of data that consists of categories that can be ordered or ranked. However, \n",
    "    \n",
    "    the distance between categories is not necessarily equal. Ordinal data is often used to measure subjective attributes\n",
    "    \n",
    "    or opinions, where there is a natural order to the responses. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Examples of ordinal data include education level (elementary/middle/high school/college), \n",
    "    \n",
    "    job position (manager/supervisor/employee), and Likert scales (strongly agree/agree/disagree/strongly disagree)\n",
    "    \n",
    "c)Interval Data:\n",

    "        Interval data is a type of data that consists of numerical values where the distance between each value is equal.\n",

    "        \n",
    "        time (hours/minutes/seconds).\n",
    "        \n",

    "distance (miles/kilometers). For instance, if someone’s height is 60 inches, it means that they are 5 feet tall,\n",
